# Overview
This is a to-do list app written with React, Sass, Webpack, Babel, and gulp. It also uses a tiny event emitter called Mitt as a Flux inspired dispatcher. Important features are unimplemented. There is no gulp task to watch the source for changes.

An understanding of ES2015 syntax will be necessary, but in your solutions you can use the syntax you feel most comfortable with.

# Setup

 * `npm install`
 * `gulp` to build the app
 * `gulp connect` to serve the app on port 8080

# Tasks

 * Implement the ability to check items off. This should result in a strike-through being applied to the item text using CSS. The UI already exists and interaction events are already wired up to the store.
 * Implement the ability to delete items.  The UI already exists and interaction events are already wired up to the store.
 * ~~Set up a gulp task to watch the src folder and trigger a build when its files are changed.~~
 * ~~Center the list item contents vertically without modifying the margin or padding of list items~~

### Bonus

* Minify built source code using Webpack or Gulp
* Improve the appearance of the UI to your liking
